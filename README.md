# PoseVisualization
  A pose/trajectory visualizatoin class implemented in C++. Inspired by ORB-SLAM2, I wroted this visualization class with a compact interface. This can be used to visualized some offline result(e.g. some RT matrices saved with .txt format) or online visualization for real-time SLAM systems.
